<h1>H-engine
</div>

**H-engine**, which stands for *Heatmob VTO Engine*, aims to build a full-fledge virtual try-on (VTO) engine that support for training, testing, evaluating,... and serving as a simple codebase to try conduct many research ideas as quick as possible in terms of implementation.

---
> [!WARNING]
> This codebase is highly developed so the everything could be broken accidently.

## TODO LIST
- [x] training code *(still under active development)*
- [x] pipeline code *(still under active development)*
- [ ] inference code
- [ ] evaluation
- [ ] legacy code (old pipeline)
- [ ] Gradio demo

## Installation
#### 1. Prerequistes
- Python >= 3.8 *(tested on Python 3.8, 3.9)*
- Pytorch 2.4.1
- Diffusers 0.30.3

#### 2. Installation via pip (venv module)
```
python3.8 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -U pip

pip install -r requirements.txt

pip install -e . (install this project as editable python module)
```

## Data Preparation
Download the **VITON-HD** dataset

```
./scripts/download.sh
```

## Downloads Models
#### IP-Adapter
Download `ip-adapter-plus_sd15.bin` from [here](https://huggingface.co/h94/IP-Adapter/blob/main/models/ip-adapter-plus_sd15.bin) and put it under the `checkpoints/` folder.


## Training
#### 1. Train on cpu
```
./scripts/train_cpu_only.sh
```

#### 2. Train on single gpu
```
./scripts/train_single_gpu.sh
```

> [!NOTE]
> Test and add support for multi-gpus soon! (almost done thanks to ðŸ¤— Accelerate)
